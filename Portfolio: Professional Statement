# Professional Statement

I am a senior at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business, majoring in Business Administration with concentrations in Accounting and Information Systems.  
My passion for cybersecurity stems from a deep commitment to protecting people, data and digital systems in an increasingly tech-dependent world.  
As our reliance on technology grows, so do the complexities of risk—this is where I see myself making a difference by learning and applying cybersecurity principles to protect individuals and organizations from evolving threats.  

With a strong foundation in risk management from my background in accounting, I am adept at identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance.  
I am now expanding my technical skills to understand and implement secure, scalable solutions that guard against potential cyber threats.  
Specifically, I am committed to developing proficiency in **Linux**, mastering the **command line interface (CLI)**, and gaining hands-on experience with **SIEM tools**—such as **Splunk** and **ELK Stack**—through home labbing.  
These efforts allow me to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity practices and strengthen my ability to respond to real-world security challenges.

My involvement in organizations like the **Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA)** and my leadership experience in mentoring at **Unite UW** have further developed my communication and problem-solving abilities, enabling me to translate complex technical concepts into actionable solutions for diverse audiences.

Driven by my values of security, integrity, and collaboration, I am focused on building real-world skills that have an immediate impact.  
Through home labbing, certifications, and hands-on experience, I’m actively refining my cybersecurity expertise and preparing to take on the next generation of security challenges.  
I’m ready to contribute to securing organizations in an evolving digital landscape and tackling the risks that come with technological growth.
