Activity Overview
Create an incident report using the knowledge you’ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. 
You will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). 
Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, 
improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization. 

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. 
Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs will help you determine 
which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

Scenario
You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, 
and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, 
which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. 
Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. 
The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings 
into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. 
This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, 
following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). 
You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity event and integrate 
your analysis into a general security strategy. We have broken the analysis into different parts in the template below. You can explore them here:

Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

Summary:
  Earlier today, our organization's internal network services were disrupted for approximately two hours due to a 
  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack exploiting ICMP protocols, specifically through an ICMP flood. 
  This attack overwhelmed our network, causing a complete halt in normal internal network traffic and preventing access to critical resources.

  In response, the incident management team took immediate action by blocking incoming ICMP packets, 
  temporarily disabling all non-essential network services, and prioritizing the restoration of critical services to regain functionality. 
  These measures helped to mitigate the attack and restore partial network access. However, the disruption resulted in financial impacts, 
  including lost productivity and delayed services.

Identify:
  The organization conducted an audit of all network devices and access policies and discovered that a critical firewall rule was unconfigured, 
  which allowed a large volume of ICMP packets to flood the network, resulting in service disruption. 
  The audit also revealed that network monitoring and detection tools were insufficient to identify the attack early enough.
Protect:
  The network security team implemented new firewall rules to verify the source of incoming ICMP packets and to limit the rate at which they were processed,
  preventing similar attacks in the future. Additionally, network monitoring software was deployed to detect abnormal traffic patterns, 
  and an IDS/IPS system was installed to filter out malicious traffic based on suspicious characteristics.
  The security team should also be trained on how to use the new IDS/IPS systems to filter out malicious traffic and interpret alerts from the network monitoring tools.
Detect:
  To enhance future detection capabilities, the organization implemented real-time traffic monitoring using an IDS and configured firewall logging tools. 
  These systems will log every incoming packet and immediately alert analysts if unusual traffic patterns are detected. 
  The team is also planning to implement more granular anomaly detection algorithms to reduce false positives.
Respond:
 In response to the incident, the security team will leverage the newly implemented logging tools to promptly detect any suspicious activity 
  and block it before it can overwhelm the network. For future incidents, the team will set up automated response procedures to 
  temporarily block or rate-limit malicious traffic. The team is also working on configuring additional filters for other protocols 
  such as TCP flooding, though we are evaluating a more targeted filtering approach to avoid affecting legitimate traffic.
  
Recover:
  The security team successfully restored critical network services and isolated non-essential services during the recovery phase. 
  The team will conduct a full scan of the network to ensure no malicious files were left behind, followed by restoring all services once the system is deemed secure. 
  Post-recovery, the team will continuously monitor the network for any signs of reoccurrence and assess the effectiveness of the changes made to prevent future incidents.
