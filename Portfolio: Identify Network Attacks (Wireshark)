Activity Overview

In this activity, you will consider a scenario involving a customer of the company that you work for who 
experiences a security issue when accessing the company’s website. You will  identify the likely cause of 
the service interruption. Then, you will explain how the attack occurred and the negative impact it had on the website. 


Scenario
You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. 
The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like. 

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. 
You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. 
You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. 
The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing 
its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor. 

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. 
You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. 
You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. 
You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. 
You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

Cybsecurity incident Report

Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption
One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. 
Specifically, the observed activity suggests a SYN flood attack, where a malicious client repeatedly initiates TCP handshakes with the web server.

The logs reveal that a user with the IP address 203.0.113.0 is continuously sending TCP requests to the web server at 192.0.2.1. 
The server responds to these [SYN] requests with [SYN, ACK], where the client does complete the handshake but continous to 
flooding the server with new SYN requests—approximately 3 requests per second.

Initially, the server manages to handle these requests along with legitimate traffic. However, over time, the influx of 
incomplete handshakes overwhelms the server, leading to a disruption in service. Eventually, the server becomes 
unresponsive to all clients, including legitimate users.

This behavior aligns with the characteristics of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exploits the server's 
resources by sending an excessive number of SYN packets, preventing it from processing legitimate connections.




Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction

When users attempt to connect to the website, the server and client engage in a three-way handshake using the TCP protocol. 
This process typically consists of the following steps:

[SYN]: The client initiates a connection by sending a SYN request to the server, indicating it wants to establish communication.
[SYN, ACK]: The server acknowledges the request and responds with a SYN-ACK message, signaling readiness to proceed.
[ACK]: The client completes the handshake by sending an ACK packet, after which communication begins.

In a SYN flood attack, the malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets to the server but never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK.
The server attempts to allocate resources for each incoming SYN request, leaving open "half-open" connections. 
As the volume of SYN packets increases, the server's connection table becomes saturated, consuming memory and CPU resources. 
This prevents the server from responding to new incoming requests, including legitimate ones.

Impact on the Server:
The logs show repeated SYN packets from the IP address 203.0.113.0, overwhelming the server with TCP requests. 
Eventually, the server stops responding entirely, leading to downtime for legitimate users attempting to access the website.
