Lab 1

In this lab, you’ll learn how to use the grep command and piping to search for files and return specific information. 
You’ll get information from different files, including server log files and user data files. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps.

Task 1. Search for error messages in a log file

analyst@25a7199377f0:~$ ls
logs  project  reports  temp
analyst@25a7199377f0:~$ cd logs
analyst@25a7199377f0:~/logs$ grep error server_logs.txt
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error   The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error   An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error   Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error   Unauthorized access

Task 2. Find files containing specific strings

Using the pipe character (|), pipe the output of the ls command to the grep command to list only the files containing the string Q1 in their names.
List the files that contain the word access in their names.

analyst@25a7199377f0:~/logs$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@25a7199377f0:~/reports/users$ ls | grep "Q1"
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
analyst@25a7199377f0:~/reports/users$ ls | grep "access"
Q1_access.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt
