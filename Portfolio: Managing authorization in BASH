Activity 1
In the Manage authorization lab, 
check the permissions set for files and subdirectories in the projects directory. Make sure you display all permissions, including hidden files
explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.


Project description
I will check the permissions set for files and subdirectories in the Projects directory, 
including all hidden files and change accordingly following a least privledges model.
This least privledges model follows the idea of granting users with only the permissions necessary on a need to know basis.


File permissions in Linux are read as follows
drwxrwxrwx 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 .

This permission could be understood as follows:
The first character pertains to stating if this is a file or a directory
  d = directory
  - = file

The next 9 characters repeat three times in a sequence r, w, and x
  r = reading privlddges, similiar to viewing on a document
  w = write such as allowing modification
  x = execute or using the application 

These repeat three times to signfiy three distinct owners
  first owner is the user or owner of the file / directory
  second owner is a collection of users who share permissions to the file
  third owner is other or anyone else


File and Directory Details in Projects:
researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 19:10 ..
-rw--w---- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 .project_x.txt
drwx--x--- 2 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 drafts
-rw-rw-rw- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_k.txt
-rw-r----- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_m.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_r.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_t.txt

Permission String Breakdown:
In file "." 
  user has permission to read, write, execute
  group has permission to read, execute
  other has permission to execute
In file ".." 
  user has permission to read, write, execute
  group has permission to read, execute
  other has permission to execute
In directory ".project_x.txt" 
  user has permission to read, write
  group has permission to write
  other has permission to NONE
In file "drafts" 
  user has permission to read, write, execute
  group has permission to write
  other has permission to NONE
In directory "project_k.txt" 
  user has permission to read, write
  group has permission to read, write
  other has permission to read, write
In directory "project_m.txt" 
  user has permission to read, write
  group has permission to read
  other has permission to NONE
In directory "project_r.txt" 
  user has permission to read, write
  group has permission to read, write
  other has permission to read
In directory "project_t.txt" 
  user has permission to read, write
  group has permission to read, write
  other has permission to read


Change File Permission 
The research team has archived .project_x.txt, which is why it’s a hidden file. 
This file should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file. 
Use a Linux command to assign .project_x.txt the appropriate authorization.


researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ chmod -R o= /home/researcher2/projects 
researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ chmod o= ..
chmod u=r,g=r .project_x.txt
researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ ls -la


drwxr-x--- 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 .
drwxr-x--- 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 19:10 ..
-r--r----- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 .project_x.txt
drwx--x--- 2 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 drafts
-rw-rw---- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_k.txt
-rw-r----- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_m.txt
-rw-rw---- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_r.txt
-rw-rw---- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Feb  1 17:39 project_t.txt

Change Directory Permissions
The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. 
Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. 

researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ chmod g= drafts
researcher2@fad62ce70320:~/projects$ ls -l
drwx------ 2 researcher2 research_team 4096 Feb  1 17:39 drafts

Summary:
After reviewing the file permissions in the project directory using linux
and permisisons standards from internal documents I noticed discrepencies in who was provided access.
From there modified file permiossion using chmod command and ensured that the correct permissions were established
by checking detailed file permissions using ls -la, which give me a long version of all files to see file permissions on
even hidden files.

Now our permissions are set according to Interal standards and adhere to the least privledges model.



---------------
Activity: Add and manage users with Linux commands
new employee with the username researcher9 joins an organization.

analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ ls
analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ whoami
analyst
analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ pwd
/home/analyst


First, you’ll add a new employee to the system and then to their primary group.
add researcher9 to the research_team group as their primary group.

analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo useradd researcher9
analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo useradd -g research_team researcher9
useradd: user 'researcher9' already exists
analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9



Seconds, you’ll add the new employee to a supplementary group. 
analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt



Finally, you’ll delete the employee from the system.
Note: When you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user
is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.



analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo usermod -G sales_team researcher9analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo userdel researcher9
userdel: group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.

analyst@9be6e1ad766e:~$ sudo groupdel researcher9
