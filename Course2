Manage Security Risks
Understand how cybersecurity professionals use frameworks and controls to protect business operations. Explore common cybersecurity tools.  

Security posture:  
An organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to changes.  


Eight CISSP secuirty domains
1. Security & risk managment / information Security (InfoSec): defining security goals based off risk mitigation and law
2. Asset security: foucsing on securing digital and physical asset and safe destroyal of asset
3. Security architecture and engineering: optimize data security by having tools are in place  
- threat modeling, least privledges, defense in depth, fail securely, seperation of duties, keep it simple, zero trust
- shared responsibility
4. Communications and network Security: manging and securing physical networks
5. Identity and Access Managament: validating identify and creating access roles; only those who need it get it
6. Security Assesment and Testing: determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. 
- security audits
- pen tester
7. Security Operation: conductive investigation and implmenting preventitive measures
- might need to implment new control like MFA
- Computer forensic of what, why, and a breach happened 
8. Software Development Security: use secure coding practices


CISSP Domain One: Security & risk managment
Defining security goals based off risk mitigation and law
Risk mitigation: Having the right procedures and rules in place to reduce impact of risk 
Business continuity: maintain everday productivity via disaster recovery plans

CISSP Domain Five: IAM
identification: username or access card
Authentication: prove you are that user
Authorization: what level of access do they have?
Accountability: monitor


Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks:  
- Threat: Any event or circumstance that negatively impacts assets.  
- Vulnerability: A weakness that can be exploited (e.g., outdated firewalls, weak passwords).  
- Risk: The combination of vulnerabilities and threats, affecting:  
  - Confidentiality: Ensuring sensitive data is protected.  
  - Integrity: Preventing unauthorized data modifications.  
  - Availability: Ensuring access to resources when needed. 

Risk Levels:  
- Low: Minimal harm to reputation, operations, or finances.  
- Medium: Potential harm to finances, operations, or reputation.  
- High: Severe consequences, such as legal violations or critical data breaches.  

Risk Management Strategies:  
- Acceptance: Acknowledging risk to maintain business continuity.  
- Avoidance: Developing plans to eliminate risks.  
- Transference: Shifting risk to a third party.  
- Mitigation: Reducing the risk's impact through proactive measures.  

Otherwise we might face financial impact: business operations stopped, fixing hack, fines
We need to start thinking about identity theft: where and how long do we store sensitive data
To ensure of reputation


ransomeware: threat actors encrypt access and demand payment to return

Common Risk Factors:  
misconfiguration
outdated systems


NIST RMF (risk Managment framework):
1 prepare: 
2 categorize: devlop risk managment task
3 select: keeping playbook up to date
4 implement: security plans
5 Assess: if security plans are efficient
6 authorize: being accountable for risk
7 monitor: aware how systems are operating

Module 2

Security frameworks: address security risk, threats, vulnerabilities
Controls: reduce specific risk


Security Frameworks and Controls:  
Frameworks help address security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.  
- RMF (Risk Management Framework): Guides risk assessment and response.  
- CSF (Cybersecurity Framework): Outlines strategies to manage cyber risks.  
- CTF (Cyber Threat Framework): Provides a common language for describing threats.  
- CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability): Ensures data protection.  
- HIPAA: Protects sensitive health data.  

Controls are measures to reduce risks:  
- Physical: Securing physical resources (e.g., locks, surveillance).  
- Technical: Implementing tools like encryption, authentication, and biometrics.  
  - Examples of authentication methods:  
    - Something you know (passwords, PINs).  
    - Something you have (tokens, access cards).  
    - Something you are (biometrics like fingerprints, facial recognition).  
  - Authorization ensures users access only what they need.  
- Administrative: Policies and procedures to govern risk management.  

NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF):  
1. Prepare: Establish context and identify risks.  
2. Categorize: Define risk management tasks.  
3. Select: Update the playbook for evolving risks.  
4. Implement: Apply and monitor security plans.  
5. Assess: Measure the effectiveness of security controls.  
6. Authorize: Take responsibility for risk management.  
7. Monitor: Continuously review and update security practices.  


Type of Controls:
Physical
Technical
Administrative

- encryption for confidentiality of data
- authentication: access to websites based off who you are (what you know, what you have)
  Something you know (passwords, PINs).
  Something you have (security tokens, access cards).
  Something you are (biometrics) – fingerprints, facial recognition, retina scans, or voice patterns come into play.
[Vising mimics your voice with an electronic voice]
-  Auhtorization: granting specific access 
  you should access to only what you need


Web Access Tiers:  
- Surface web: Publicly accessible content.  
- Deep web: Requires authorization (e.g., organizational intranets).  
- Dark web: Accessed via specialized software for anonymous activity. 

---
CIA: Security model ensuring data protection for settng up security policy and systems 
- Confidentiality: Ensuring only authorized users can access data (Need to know basis)
- Integrity: correct, authentic, reliable data
- Availability: Those who are authorized to access it

---
CSF (Cybersecurity Framework): Outlines strategies to manage cyber risks.
1. Identify
Manage assets and understand organizational risk.
Understand the organization’s business environment and critical functions.
Establish governance structures for cybersecurity alignment with business goals.
Conduct risk assessments and develop risk management strategies.
2. Protect
Implement access control and protect data.
Ensure users receive training and awareness of cybersecurity responsibilities.
Develop and implement information protection processes and procedures.
Maintain systems regularly and use technology to safeguard data and assets.
3. Detect
Continuously monitor systems for anomalies and events.
Analyze detected anomalies and incidents for a timely response.
4. Respond
Develop incident response plans and communicate effectively during incidents.
Analyze, mitigate, and improve response strategies to reduce impact.
5. Recover

OWASP (Open web applications security project)
https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/

- Minimize Attack Surface Area
Reduce potential external vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit.

- Principle of Least Privilege
Grant users only the access necessary for their tasks, limiting internal vulnerabilities.

- Defense in Depth
Use multiple security controls (e.g., MFA, intrusion detection) to address risks in various ways.

- Separation of Duties
Ensure critical tasks are performed by multiple individuals to prevent misuse.

- Keep Security Simple
Avoid unnecessary complexity; simpler security fosters manageability and collaboration.

- Fix Security Issues Correctly
Identify root causes of incidents, contain impact, and verify fixes through testing.

- Establish Secure Defaults
The default state of an application should be its most secure configuration, making it harder to make it insecure.

- Fail Securely
When a security control fails, it should default to the most secure option. For example, a failing firewall should block all connections rather than accepting all.

- Don’t Trust Services
Organizations should not implicitly trust third-party services. For example, verify external systems before sharing sensitive data.

- Avoid Security by Obscurity
Key systems' security should not depend on keeping details hidden
---
Security Audit
Evaluate how frameworks, controls, security principles, and compliance regulations work together to safeguard an organization. 

The audit seeks to answer several key questions:
What is the audit meant to achieve?
Which assets are most at risk?
Are current controls sufficient to protect these assets?
What additional controls or compliance regulations need to be implemented?

Factors Influencing Audit Types:
Industry type
Organization size
Government regulations
Business geographical location
Decision to adhere to specific regulatory compliance


- Establishing Scope and Goals:
Scope: Identify individuals, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies that impact security posture
Goals: Define what the audit aims to achieve in terms of improving security

- Conducting Risk Assessment:
Identify potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

- Complete Controls Assessment:
Classify controls (administrative, technical, physical)
Evaluate if the organization adheres to laws and regulations

- Assessing Compliance:
Ensure the organization complies with applicable laws and regulations

- Communicating Results to Stakeholders:
Summarize scope and goals of the audit
List identified risks
Describe how risks need to be addressed
Identify relevant laws for compliance
Provide recommendations for improving security posture
