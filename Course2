Manage Security Risks
Identify how cybersecurity professionals use frameworks and controls to protect business operations, and explore common cybersecurity tools.


Security posture: An organizationâ€™s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change

Eight CISSP secuirty domains
1. Security & risk managment / information Security (InfoSec): defining security goals based off risk mitigation and law
2. Asset security: foucsing on securing digital and physical asset and safe destroyal of asset
3. Security architecture and engineering: optimize data security by having tools are in place  
- threat modeling, least privledges, defense in depth, fail securely, seperation of duties, keep it simple, zero trust
- shared responsibility
4. Communications and network Security: manging and securing physical networks
5. Identity and Access Managament: validating identify and creating access roles; only those who need it get it
6. Security Assesment and Testing: determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. 
- security audits
- pen tester
7. Security Operation: conductive investigation and implmenting preventitive measures
- might need to implment new control like MFA
- Computer forensic of what, why, and a breach happened 
8. Software Development Security: use secure coding practices


Security posture

1) Security & risk managment: defining security goals based off risk mitigation and law
Risk mitigation: Having the right procedures and rules in place to reduce impact of risk 
Business continuity: maintain everday productivity via disaster recovery plans

IAM
identification: username or access card
Authentication: prove you are that user
Authorization: what level of access do they have?
Accountability: monitor

surface web
deep web: require authorization (organization's websites)
dark web: accessed by special software

Threat: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
Vulnerability: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat
- firewall needing update, weak password, people
> vulnerability + threat = risk

Risk: anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset

low risk: would not harm organization reputation or ongoing opertons & would not harm financial data
medium risk: information not available to the public and may cause damage to organization's finance, reputation or ongoing operations
high risk: information protected with laws. compromised will damage company

ransomeware: threat actors encrypt access and demand payment to return

financial: stop business, fixing hack, fines
identity theft: where and how long do we store sensitive data
reputation

Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk

misconfiguration
outdated systems


NIST RMF (risk manamgnet framework):
1 prepare: 
2 categorize: devlop risk managment task
3 select: keeping playbook up to date
4 implement: security plans
5 Assess: if security plans are efficient
6 authorize: being accountable for risk
7 monitor: aware how systems are operating

Module 2

Security frameworks: address security risk, threats, vulnerabilities
Controls: reduce specific risk
