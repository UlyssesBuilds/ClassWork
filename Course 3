Course 3 Networks and Networks Security
Gain an understanding of network-level vulnerabilities and how to secure networks.

Strcuture of a network
Standard network tools
cloud network
TCP/IP

Network: group of connected devices
  wireless
  wired
IP protocol ensures the devices connect to the right device

CLI intereact with various level of OS
low level: memory / kernel
high level: application

log parsing: Help figure out and debug by finding the root issue
Network traffic analysis: why is internet slow, not routed appropriately, ensure network is up and runnung

Servers: provide information and services for devices
hub: constant broadcast what is happening in the network (insecure and traffic congestion)
Switch: direct broadcast between devices on a network (controls flow of traffic and security)
Router: connects multiple networks together by talking to other routers (floor to floor)
Firewall: monitors traffic and restricts incoming and outgoing network traffic (sits between internal network and untrusted outside network)
Modem: connects router to the internret 

> virtualization tools can carry out these same task for cost savings and scaleability 

Cloud networks:
Reliability
Cost
Scalability

CSP (cloud service provider)
Iaas (Infrastructure as a service)
Paas (Platform as a service):
Saas (Software as a service): 

IaaS: Provides physical components of an IT system that support computing and storage
  Servers: Physical machines that process and store data.
  Networking Equipment: Routers, switches, and cables to connect systems.
  Storage Devices: Hard drives, SSDs, and storage arrays.
  Data Centers: Facilities housing the above hardware.
> You handle everything else (software infrastructure)
	OS: windows, Linux, macOS
	Middleware: Software that enable communication between apps (API)
	Database: tools to store, manage and retrieve data (mySQL)

Example: Renting virtual machines on AWS to host an application.
Key Point: Complete control over software but you are responsible for updates, security, and configuration.


Platform as a service (PaaS)
A pre-configured platform that provides the software infrastructure needed to develop, run, and manage applications.
	The provider handles hardware, OS,, middleware and developer tools.
> You focus on creating and managing your applicatiot without worrying about maintaining the underlying systems.
	You don't have direct control of the data, people, or infrastructure
	Trained security professionals are watching your stuff

Example: Square space


Software as a service (SaaS)
- Fully managed software and applications that are ready for end-users.
- Requires no installation, updates, or infrastructure setup.
Examples: Gmail, Microsoft 365.
	Give username and password and now an entire email system is available to you
	Email, spreadsheets all managed by Microsoft
Key Point: Plug-and-play services requiring no technical expertise.
	You get a service, you cannot code your service

data packet: basic unit of information that travels acrsoss devices in a network
Where its going, where its from , and the content of the message

Header: what to do with the data packet
Body: message that needs to be transmitted
Footer: signals end of the packet 

Bandwidth: measures network performance
- amount of data a device receieves every second
SppedL rate of packets are recieved or downloaded

packet sniffing captures and inspect data packets
- irregularities in speed or bandwith may indicate an attack

TCP/IP
TCP: Ensures the data you send arrives complete and in order (focuses on reliability)
IP: Ensures the data is routed to the correct device (focuses on addressing and routing)
Port: software based locatino to organize sending and receiving data between devices on a network

UDP: user datagram protocol

simplified 4 layer TCP/IP strcuture 
(Combines the Data Link and Physical layers into a single Network Access Layer for simplicity.)
4. Application Layer:
Handles data exchange between applications (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP).
3. Transport Layer:
Manages data delivery reliability (e.g., TCP, UDP).
- flow of traffic, error control, and status of connection 
2. Internet Layer:
Handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP).
- how networks connect to each other
1. Network Access Layer: Deals with hardware and physical transmission (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- transmission of data packets

---
Public IP provided by ISP to connect to the world
Private IP provided by router to communicate in a LAN
MAC address: Physical address
ARP: determines the MAC address of the next router or device on the path
---


Layer 7 (Application Layer)
This is where the user interacts directly with the system.
Examples of applications: Google Chrome, Outlook, Discord.
Protocols used: HTTP.

Layer 6 (Presentation Layer)
Receives data from the Application Layer and ensures it is readable upon arrival.
It encrypts, compresses, and ensures the data is not distorted or tampered with during transmission.

Layer 5 (Session Layer)
Handles starting and ending communication sessions.
Manages the ports to be used for connections and establishes those connections.

Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
Breaks long messages into smaller packets for transmission.
TCP vs UDP:

TCP: Establishes an end-to-end session between sender and receiver, ensuring all packets arrive.
UDP: Connectionless and doesn’t guarantee that all packets are received.
Layer 3 (Network Layer)
Determines the destination IP address for the packets.
Uses DNS (Domain Name System) to resolve domain names to IP addresses and figures out the most efficient route the packet should take, including hops along the network.

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
Works closely with the physical layer to manage data link and error correction.
Ensures that data is formatted correctly for transmission, manages logical circuits, and prevents collisions.
When using TCP, it ensures reliable transmission; UDP does not handle error correction.

Layer 1 (Physical Layer)
Data is transmitted as binary signals, like electrical pulses, radio waves, or light pulses.
1 represents "on", 0 represents "off".
It’s responsible for the actual transmission of data over the physical medium.

VPN (Virtual Private Network)

VPN is a security service that changes your public IP address andhides your virtual location to keep data private 
- encyrpts
- encapsulation: protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets. 
  This ensures there is still a header to route information but no one can read sensitive data
- Tunneling: between device and VPN server which is unhackable without a key


Network Segmentation:
    - Divides the network into smaller, manageable segments.
    - Each segment has its own access permissions and security rules.
    - Purpose: Enhances security and limits access to sensitive resources.

Security Zones:
    - Definition: Specific segments of the network with different security measures.
    - Types:
        Uncontrolled Zone:
            - Any network outside the organization's control.
        Controlled Zone:
            - Protects the internal network from uncontrolled zones.
            - Includes:
                - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):
                    - Public-facing servers accessible to the internet.
                    - Acts as a perimeter network to protect internal systems.
                - Internal Network:
                    - Private servers and organizational data.
                    - Requires protection from external threats.
                - Restricted Zone:
                    - Contains highly confidential information.
                    - Access is significantly limited to authorized users.

Subnets:
    - Definition: segmentation within the internal network.
    - Purpose: Isolates network traffic for security and network efficiency.
    - Examples:
        - Marketing and Finance departments have their own subnets.
        - Students and Faculty separated into distinct subnets for different access needs.

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation for subnetting):
method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create a subnet (198.51.100.0/24)
https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr

[
Previously Classful addressing was used in the 1980s as a system of grouping IP addresses into classes (Class A to Class E).
Problem: The rigid structure led to wasted IP addresses and growing number of devices quickly depleted available IPs
Class A: Huge range (for very large organizations)
Class B: Medium range (for mid-sized organizations)
Class C: Small range (for small organizations)
]

Firewalls should be implemented between each layer of Internet, DMZ, Internal Network, Restricted Zone
Security Analyst: Responsible for regulating access controls for firewalls (resitrcition based on IP, Ports)

VPN Protocols to encrypt traffic over network tunnel
Factors to consider: connection speeds, compatibility with existing network infrastructure, and business or individual needs.

Wireguard: high-speed VPN protocol, with advanced encryption, to protect users when they are accessing the internet
- simple and easy to set up and maintain
- used for both site-to-site connection and client server connection
- open source, easier to debug and deploy
- newer
IPSec: encrypt and authenticate data packets in order to establish secure, encrypted connections
- older and has much more OS support fromn VPN providers

Proxy Server (additional security)
Sits in the middle of an internet connection so proxy server is the one interacting with internet by hidding IP address
	Forward proxies: handle queries from internal clients and approves all outgoing request
	Reverse proxies: Proxy provides results back to the client after examining for malicious content
  Caches on frequently visited websites on temporary Memory enhancing security by reducing external contact

> This is used for each server such as email proxy

' Network-Level DoS Attacks
' Slow Bandwidth Attacks
    ' SYN Flood Attack
        ' Simulates a TCP connection by sending SYN packets.
        ' Overwhelms the server by exceeding the number of available ports.
        ' Process:
            ' 1. Attacker sends a SYN request.
            ' 2. Server reserves a port and waits for a response (ACK).
            ' 3. Attacker never sends the ACK, leaving the port in a half-open state.
        ' Result:
            ' - Ports are consumed.
            ' - Server becomes overwhelmed and cannot handle legitimate connections.

    ' ICMP Flood
        ' What is ICMP?
            ' - Internet Control Message Protocol.
            ' - Used by devices to send control messages and error reports (e.g., unreachable destinations or timeouts).
            ' - Facilitates diagnostics (e.g., ping, traceroute) and helps manage network traffic.
            ' - Packets are not rebroadcasted; they are sent directly between devices.
        ' Attack Process:
            ' 1. Attacker repeatedly sends ICMP packets to a network server (ping).
            ' 2. Server is forced to send ICMP responses (echo replies) for each request.

' Malicious Packet Sniffing
   ' Packet Structure:
        ' - Header: Information about where the packet is from (source).
        ' - Body: Contains potentially valuable data (e.g., login credentials, sensitive information).
        ' - Footer: Usually includes error checking or control information.

    ' Sniffing Methods:
        ' 1. Passive Packet Sniffing
            ' - Attacker simply reads data packets in transit without interfering with them.
            ' - Data is captured as it passes through the network.

        ' 2. Active Packet Sniffing
            ' - Attacker actively changes data packets in transit.
            ' - Methods include:
                ' - Injecting malicious internet protocols to redirect traffic to unintended ports.
                ' - Altering information inside the packet (e.g., changing a destination address).

' Protection Against Packet Sniffing
    ' VPN (Virtual Private Network):
        ' - Encrypts data before transmission, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting the packets.
        	Even if a hacker intercepts the packets, they cannot read the encrypted data.

    ' HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
        ' - Utilizes SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmitted over the internet.
        	Encrypts both the request and the response, ensuring privacy and integrity of data.

    ' Avoid Unprotected Wi-Fi:
        ' - Public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks are vulnerable to packet sniffing.
        ' - Always use encrypted connections or VPN when using public Wi-Fi.

IP Spoofing and Related Network Attacks
Overview of IP Spoofing
IP spoofing is a network attack where an attacker alters the source IP address of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system. 
This allows them to gain unauthorized access to a network or conduct malicious activities while disguising their identity.

Types of Attacks Involving IP Spoofing
- On-Path Attack:
Description: The attacker positions themselves in the middle of a legitimate communication channel between two authorized systems.
Impact: They intercept or alter data in transit, often leveraging the IP and MAC addresses to impersonate one of the communicating parties.
Objective: Eavesdrop, manipulate, or disrupt the communication without the parties noticing.
[go back to packet sniffing: there is passive and active]


- Replay Attack:
Description: A malicious actor intercepts a valid data packet and delays or reuses it later.
Impact: By replaying the data at a different time, the attacker can impersonate an authorized user, 
potentially gaining access to restricted resources or bypassing authentication mechanisms.

- Smurf Attack:
Description: This combines IP spoofing with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
Mechanism: The attacker spoofs an authorized user’s IP address and floods the network with ICMP packets.
Impact: The massive influx of packets overwhelms the network, bypassing firewalls and causing denial of service to legitimate users.


Preventative Measures Against IP Spoofing
Firewall Configuration:
Firewalls can be configured to combat IP spoofing by rejecting incoming traffic that mimics local network IP addresses.
If a private IP address from the local network originates from an external source, the firewall will deny the transmission, 
as all devices with that IP should already reside on the local network.
Example: Reject all incoming traffic that has the same IP address as the local network.

Additional Strategies:
Network Segmentation: Limit the exposure of critical systems by isolating them within secure segments.
Packet Filtering: Use ingress and egress filtering to ensure that packets with spoofed IPs do not traverse the network.
Authentication and Encryption: Strengthen authentication protocols and encrypt sensitive data to mitigate risks from on-path and replay attacks.

Module 4: Security Hardening
Strengthening a sytem to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface
Attack Surface: All potential vulernabilites that a threat actor can exploit


Security Hardening
Hardware Hardening
OS hardening
Application
Network Hardening
Cloud hardening
Databases


Common security hardening
Device configuration changes (more frequent password changes)
Physical space (CCTV)
Disabling unused application, devices, and ports to reduce attack surfaces
Penetration testing: simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in a system, network, website, app, processes

	Security Analyst responsibilities:
	Patch updates (software updates)
	Backups

OS hardening

First program when a computer is turned on
OS is the intermediarary between software appliucation and computer hardware

one insecure OS can compromise whole network 


Regular hardering
Patch update: software update
- Run Patches ASAP, especially ones that fix known vulnerabilities 
OS publish a patch and vulnerability fix, malicious actors know exactly where the vulnerability is in the system

> This should then be added to the baseline OS (baseline configuration / image)
- documened set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases and updates
may contain: firewall rules

Hardware & Software disposal
Properly wipe and dispose of and removing unused software

Strong password policy
- losing access after incorrect attempt x times
MFA: something you know, something you have, something unique about you

OS attacks
Brute force: trial-and-error process of discovering private information. 
Simple brute force attack: randomly entering any combo of usernames and passwords
Dictionary Attacks: attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system

Assessing vulnerabilities
VM (Virutal Machines)
Sandbox enviroments: type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network
Commonly used for testing patches, identifying and address bugs or det
Stand alone physical computers not connected to a network but more costly than VM

module 4 Cloud Security

Cloud Security Module

    1. Cloud Security Fundamentals

        - Cloud Vulnerabilities
            - CSP Limitations
                - Cannot prevent all intrusions
                - Organizations must actively monitor security
            - Cloud Migration Risks
                - Moving software without adaptation can introduce security gaps
                - Legacy systems may create vulnerabilities

        - Shared Responsibility Model
            - CSPs secure cloud infrastructure
            - Organizations configure and secure their cloud services
            - Security misconfigurations are the organization’s responsibility

    2. Cloud Security Hardening

        - Baselining
            - Establishes a fixed reference point for cloud security
            - Security measures:
                - Restricting admin portal access
                - Enabling password management
                - Enabling file encryption
                - Activating threat detection services for SQL databases
	> used to check if anything has changed

        - OS Hardening Practices
            - Data and applications should be separated based on:
                - Service category
                - Age (older applications separate from newer ones)
                - Function (internal vs. external software)

        - Configuration Complexity
            - Expanding cloud services requires precise configurations
            - Misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities
            - Risk increases during cloud migration

    3. Cloud Security Technologies

        - Hypervisors
            - Abstract the host's hardware from the OS environment
            - Types:
                1. Runs directly on hardware (VMware)
			- replaces the computer's main OS with the hypervisor itself and directly controls the CPU, etc
			- used in cloud data centers / enterprise evnrioments for optimized performance, security, and efficiency
                2. Operates within host software (VirtualBox)
			- Just like an app
            - Managed by CSPs; vulnerabilities can lead to VM escapes

        - Identity & Access Management (IAM)
            - Organizes digital identities and authorizes user access
            - Loose configurations can allow unauthorized access

        - Visibility & Tracking
            - On-premise admins have full packet-level visibility
		Packet-level visibility means you can see every data packet traveling through your network.
		You can inspect, analyze, and potentially block any traffic that looks suspicious or harmful.
		Admins have control over all traffic routes, logs, and can monitor everything in real-time.
            - Cloud environments:
		CSPs provide security but limit customer access to traffic monitoring
		limited traffic monitoring due to multiple organizations sharing the same physical
                - Flow logs: summary of network traffic that show metafata but not the actual content
			traffic went from IP address A to IP address B on port 443 (HTTPS) at a specific time
			> logs help with identifying patterns or detecting anomalies that could indicate potential threats.
                - Packet mirroring
			duplicating the network packets and sending a copy to a monitoring or analysis system.
			This allows cloud admins to inspect the actual data traffic being exchanged between instances.
			> enables more detailed traffic inspection and analysis, similar to what an on-premise admin would have/
			not usually set by default
            - Third-party audits assess CSP security

    4. Cryptography & Key Management in the Cloud

        - Encryption & Data Integrity
            - Ensures data confidentiality through encryption
            - Secure key management systems protect encryption keys

        - Cryptographic Erasure
	  process of making encrypted data permanently unrecoverable by deleting the encryption keys used to protect it.
            - Crypto-shredding: Technique to destroys cryptographic keys used for decryption
	    - Deletes encryption keys to render data unrecoverable
	> Securely destroying senseitive data

        - KMS (Key Management Systems)
            - TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
                - specialized hardware chip installed on devices to securely stores passwords, certificates, and encryption keys
		- Isolates itself from other software and is physically tamper resistant so even if the hardware or system is compromised it is reliable. 
            - CloudHSM (Cloud Hardware Security Module)
                - Cloud based servivce to securely stores cryptographic keys
                - Performs cryptographic operations (encryption, decryption)
		> cloud - native "TPM"

        - Customer Responsibility for Encryption
            - BYOK (Bring your own keys)
		Customers may provide their own encryption keys
		- basically not relying on CSP default enryuption keys but using one own's encryption key
		to have control over their encrypt and decryption process to ensuring exclusive control over their data
            		> CSPs cannot assist if customer keys are lost or compromised.
			> data becomes permanently inaccessible
            - Organizations must assess CSP security through audits to ensure that CSP's KMS are secured
		(e.g., FEDRAMP for federal contractors)

    5. Cloud Security Best Practices

        - Baseline Security Measures
            - Use a server baseline image for cloud instances
            - Compare cloud data to baseline images for unauthorized changes
		    - Restricting access to the admin portal
	            - Enabling password management
	            - Enabling file encryption
	            - Activating threat detection services for SQL databases

        - CSP Security Responsibilities
            - Stay up to date on security threats & attack surfaces
            - Monitor and respond to zero-day vulnerabilities
	    - manage the hypervisor and other virtualization components
	        - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can lead to VM escapes
	        - Customers rarely interact directly with hypervisors

        - Impact on Organizations
            - Companies must update IT processes for cloud security
            - Cloud networking provides affordable security for small businesses
            - Increased security complexity requires dedicated personnel


    Shared Responsibility in Cloud Security
	- CSP is responsible for security involving the infastr4ucutre, physical data centers, hypervisor, host operating system
	- client is responsible for assets and process that they store and operate in the cloud
	> A problem occurs when organizations assume that the CSP is taking care of security that they have not taken responsibility for.
