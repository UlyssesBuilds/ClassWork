Course 3 Networks and Networks Security
Gain an understanding of network-level vulnerabilities and how to secure networks.

Strcuture of a network
Standard network tools
cloud network
TCP/IP

Network: group of connected devices
  wireless
  wired
IP protocol ensures the devices connect to the right device

CLI intereact with various level of OS
low level: memory / kernel
high level: application

log parsing: Help figure out and debug by finding the root issue
Network traffic analysis: why is internet slow, not routed appropriately, ensure network is up and runnung

Servers: provide information and services for devices
hub: constant broadcast what is happening in the network (insecure and traffic congestion)
Switch: direct broadcast between devices on a network (controls flow of traffic and security)
Router: connects multiple networks together by talking to other routers (floor to floor)
Firewall: monitors traffic and restricts incoming and outgoing network traffic (sits between internal network and untrusted outside network)
Modem: connects router to the internret 

> virtualization tools can carry out these same task for cost savings and scaleability 

Cloud networks:
using remote servers than local devices
